# Khazeni Website (HTML-Basics)
I'm learning the basics of **html** and **git** while developing my own website.

Git Signature : *134c507*

*I plan to use this site in the future if it ends up looking good!*

For the second part of our project, I plan to work on nice responsive elements around the website. (Such as elements that react when you hover/click/etc. on them)

## Goals
On my website, I plan to include:
|Goal                |ASCII                          |
