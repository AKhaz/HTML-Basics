# Khazeni Website (HTML-Basics)
I'm learning the basics of **html** and **git** while developing my own website.

Git Signature : *e6b9607*

*I plan to use this site in the future if it ends up looking good!*

For the second part of our project, I plan to work on nice responsive elements around the website. (Such as elements that react when you hover/click/etc. on them)

## Bootstrap Additions

For bootstrap, I added 5 features I thought were cool.
1. Notification bar
2. New Table
3. Custom Background Color
4. Jumbotron/Title
5. Navbar Icon
6. Tooltip (Didn't really work)
